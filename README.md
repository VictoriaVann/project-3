              <strong>First Deliverable:</strong> Use your Project Two directory in Github to create a 
              Project Three directory. You can fork it or just copy and paste. Create a new Basecamp post 
              under "Project Three" with a link to your new directory. Your post should include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The URL to your Project 3 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages 
                  live link
                </li>
                <li>
                  Eight screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for
                  each website page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students
                </li>
              </ul>  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Second Deliverable:</strong> Give constructive comments to help at least three other
              students. Post a picture of those three comments on your Basecamp folder. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Final Deliverable:</strong> You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required 
              fixes from the professor or TA. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the 
              words "FINAL TURN IN".

              Pick one page to make mobile friendly. This means adding 2 CSS media queries with 
              at least 5 CSS style changes under each. Use the min-width media queries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add a fourth html page for your Google Maps api. The map should have 3 features added beyond the base code. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Add one valid, error-free JavaScript file with your original code; 
              linked from the head of all four HTML files
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure your JavaScript throws no uncaught errors and is loaded unobtrusively.
              You can check for errors using the console on your browser inspector
            </li>
            <li>
              For the final turn-in, add a JavaScript picture slider to one of your pages.
